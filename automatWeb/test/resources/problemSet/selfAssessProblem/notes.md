# Solution Notes

Notes on a problem solution may be written in Markdown notation
and will be included in the grade report.

* Graphics may be included, but must be given as a path relative to the problem directory.

    * Via markdown:

        ![foo.png](foo.png)

    * Direct inclusion

        <img src="foo.png"/>
