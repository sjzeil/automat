## Modes of Operation

The Automat editor can function in three distinct modes:

1. A *free-form* editor, for use in preparing formal languages not tied to a specific problem, and (probably) not requiring students to log in.
2. A *self-assessment* editor, in which students have been directed to solve a specific problem and may request immediate feedback on how well they have done, including viewing a sample solution (provided by hte instructor).
3. A *graded problem* editor, in which students are be directed to solve a specific problem and to submit their work for grading. The sample solution and feedback are withheld until released by an instructor or grader.
