The Automat editor does not store your work in files. Instead, each formal language has a unique URL that can be used to recreate it.

To save your work at any point in time, look for the `Save` button near the top of the editing area.

When you click on the `Save` button, two things will happen:

1. The "save" URL for your current language is added to your browser's history.
    * Hitting the browser's refresh button _before_ a save will take you back to an empty editor - all your changes will be lost.
    * Hitting the browser's refresh button _after_ a save will take you back to the most recently saved version of your language.
    * You can also use the browser's "back" and "forward" buttons to move back and forth through the history of your saves during this browser session.
2. The  "save" URL for your current language is copied to your clipboard.
    * To permanently save your language, paste this URL (or the one appearing in the browser's URL bar) into a text file, email, or word processing document of your choice, or bookmark it in your browser.

In addition, **if** you have logged in to use the editor and if you are working on a specific problem for an assignment or test (the title of the page will be something more specific than the generic "Formal Language Editor"), then your URL for that problem is saved on the website.

* You and your instructor can retrieve that saved URL using the `Load` button.
* Only one URL will be saved per student per problem. If you `Save` again for the same problem, the new "save" URL replaces the previous one for that problem.
