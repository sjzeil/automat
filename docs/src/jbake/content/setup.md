## Contents of the Automat Distribution

## Three URLs

A typical setup will employ three distinct URLs.

1. A free-form editor, for use in preparing formal languages not tied to a specific problem, and (probably) not requiring students to log in.
2. A self-assessment editor, so that students may be directed to solve a specific problem and be given a sample solution and immediate feedback on how well they have done.
3. A testing editor, so that students may be directed so solve a specific problem and submit their work for grading, with the solution and feedback withheld until released by an instructor or grader.

## User Authentication

User authentication is handled outside of Automat by Apache-style `.htaccess` files.
