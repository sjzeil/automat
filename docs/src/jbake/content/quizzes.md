When working on a self-assessment problem, the instructor will provide you with a special link to invoke the editor. 

> You **must** use that link to prepare your answer.

You will "submit" your answer by saving your language URL into the text entry box for the online question.

* Use the `Save` button to copy your language's URL to the clipboard.
* Paste that URL into the answer area of your quiz/test/whatever.

For graded activities, the `Grade Report` button will be deactivated. After your submitted work has been graded, the instructor or TA may provide you with a link to the grade report as part of the feedback on your answer.
