When you are taking an online quiz, exam, or other graded activity, you will "submit" your answer by saving your language URL into the text entry box for the online question.

* Use the `Save` button to copy your language's URL to the clipboard.
* Paste that URL into the answer area of your quiz/test/whatever.

For graded activities, the `Grade Report` button will be deactivated. After your submitted work has been graded, the instructor or TA may provide you with a link to the grade report as part of the feedback on your answer.
